# Machine Learning and Neural Networks Repository

The "ML" repository is a comprehensive resource for machine learning (ML) and neural networks (NN), covering a wide range of topics and techniques essential for ML engineers and data scientists. This repository not only includes foundational concepts and tutorials but also features advanced research projects in various domains like image classification, natural language processing (NLP), speech recognition, video analysis, and more. It may be both to serve as both a learning tool and a practical guide for those working in the field of machine learning and data science.

## Repository Structure

### 1. `CourceML`
The `CourceML` directory is dedicated to the foundational aspects of machine learning. It provides essential knowledge for working with data using Python, focusing on the following key areas:

- [**Pandas**](https://pandas.pydata.org/): Tutorials and examples on how to use the Pandas library for data manipulation and preprocessing, which is crucial for preparing datasets before feeding them into ML models.
- **Basic Models with [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html)**:
  - **Regression**: Implementations of various regression techniques using `scikit-learn`, including linear regression.
  - **Classification**: Fundamental classification algorithms, such as logistic regression.
  - **Clustering**: Examples of unsupervised learning techniques, including k-means clustering.
  - **Recommender Systems**: Basic recommender systems using collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques are explored, providing insights into how these systems work.

### 2. `DAILY_WORK`
This folder contains scripts and notebooks used for daily experimentation and testing of new concepts or ideas. The files here are treated as drafts, where you can explore various theories, verify new information, or experiment with different approaches before developing them into full-fledged projects. This area serves as a sandbox for continuous learning and innovation.

### 3. `IMPORTANT_PROGRAMMES`
This directory is subdivided into two main folders, each containing full-cycle research projects. These projects start from data collection and preprocessing, move through model training and evaluation, and often conclude with real-world applications or insights. The projects in this directory can be seen as comprehensive case studies or research papers in code form.

- **`SKL` (scikit-learn)**:
  - This folder contains projects where machine learning models are developed using the `scikit-learn` library. These projects cover a wide range of applications:
    - **Simple Regression Models**: Classic regression tasks to predict numerical outcomes based on input features.
    - **Multi-class Image Classification**: Projects involving the classification of images into multiple categories, such as distinguishing between different animal species.
    - **Audio Processing**: Speech recognition and audio signal processing projects that demonstrate how to work with and classify sound data.
    - **NLP (Natural Language Processing)**: Projects focused on text data, including sentiment analysis, text classification, and language modeling.

- **`TF` ([TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/?hl=ru))**:
  - This folder houses projects that utilize neural networks, implemented using TensorFlow. Some projects mirror the problems tackled in the `SKL` folder but approach them through deep learning instead of traditional ML techniques. Other projects in this folder delve into more advanced topics:
    - **Image Segmentation**: Advanced techniques for segmenting images into meaningful parts, crucial for applications like medical imaging.
    - **Video Analysis**: Solutions that consider the temporal dimension in video data, processing sequences of frames collectively rather than individually, which is essential for tasks like action recognition in videos.
    - **Complex Neural Networks**: Examples include convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for sequential data processing.

### 4. `LIBRARY`
The `LIBRARY` directory contains a collection of tutorials and educational resources that are not standalone projects but rather explorations of specific techniques or tools. These tutorials are invaluable for those looking to deepen their understanding of machine learning and neural networks.

- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Techniques like PCA (Principal Component Analysis), LDA and NCA are covered, which are essential for reducing the number of features in a dataset while preserving important information.
- **CatBoost**: A dedicated guide to working with CatBoost, a gradient boosting library that is particularly effective with categorical data and is known for its performance in competitions.
- **Classification, Clustering, and Regression Metrics**:
  - This file is a comprehensive reference for various metrics used in machine learning. It includes:
    - **Descriptions** of metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score for classification; silhouette score, Davies-Bouldin index for clustering; and RÂ², mean squared error (MSE) for regression.
    - **Formulas** for calculating each metric, ensuring clarity on how they are derived.
    - **Use Cases** that explain when and why to use a particular metric.
    - **Best Practices** indicating what values of these metrics signify a well-performing model.
